It is where the African Union is headquartered and where its predecessor the Organization of African Unity (OAU) was based. It also hosts the headquarters of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), as well as various other continental and international organizations.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Northern Routes</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Northern Ethiopia can be divided into two geographical regions: the highlands to the west, and containing Ethiopia's highest peak at Ras Dashen, and the Afar lowlands to the east, containing the country's lowest point in the Danakil Depression. The Ethiopian Highlands are very different from what one might imagine when thinking of East Africa. The landscape is unique to this area.</p>

          <h5 class="card-title">Southern Routes</h5>
          <p class="card-text">The Lower Omo River in south west Ethiopia is home to eight different tribes whose population is about 200,000 inhabitants. They have lived there for centuries. The Lower Omo Valley is a spectacularly beautiful area with diverse ecosystems including grasslands, volcanic outcrops, and one of the few remaining riverine forests in semi-arid Africa which supports a wide variety of wildlife.

          <h5 class="card-title">Eastern Routes</h5>
          <p class="card-text">It is some measure of the Danakil's geological activity that more than 30 active or dormant volcanoes-roughly one-quarter of the African total are listed by the Smithsonian Institute Global Volcanism Program. These volcanoes are all geological infants, having formed over the past million years, and a great many took their present shape within the last 10,000 years. 
            Very attractive extension option to Awash National Park and the fascinating holy city of Harar (UNESCO world heritage site). May be perfectly combined with a Northern- or Southern Ethiopia trip.

There was previously some other washed coffees in Limu, where the state owned farm Kossa started with washed coffees about 30 years ago. It is also ideal place for coffee tours.

              Ethiopian Airlines (Ethiopian) is the fastest growing airline in Africa. In its seven decades of operation, Ethiopian has become one of the continent’s leading carriers, unrivalled in efficiency and operational success.

              Ethiopian commands the lion's share of the pan-African passenger and cargo network operating the youngest and most modern fleet across five continents. Ethiopian fleet includes ultra-modern and environmentally friendly aircraft such as Airbus A350, Boeing 787,
              
              Boeing 777-300ER, Boeing 777-200LR, Boeing 777-200 Freighter, and Bombardier Q-400 double cabin.   Ethiopian was the first airline in Africa to own and operate each of these aircraft.
              
              Ethiopian is currently implementing a 15-year strategic plan called Vision 2025 that will see it become the leading aviation group in Africa with seven business centers:
              
              Ethiopian Domestic and Regional Airline; Ethiopian International Passenger Airline; Ethiopian Cargo; Ethiopian MRO; Ethiopian Aviation Academy; Ethiopian In-flight Catering Services; and Ethiopian Ground Service. Ethiopian is a multi-award winning airline registering an average annual growth of 25% in the past seven years.
